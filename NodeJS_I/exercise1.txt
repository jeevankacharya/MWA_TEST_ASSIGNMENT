1)Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?

Ans: SetTimeout is simply like calling the function after delayed has finished.Whenever the function is called it is not 
executed immediately but queued so that its is executed after all the executing and currently queued eventhandlers finished finished
first but setImmediate is similar except it doesnt use queue of the functions.We use setImmediate if we want to queue the function
behind whatever  I/O event callbacks that are already in the event queue.

2)Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?


Ans: The main difference between setImmediate and process.nextTick is that setImmediate queues its callbacks on the event loop while
process.nextTick doesn't.
